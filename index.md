# This is a simple CRUD contact website
As a test from Code.id and Jenius, I make this website.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/vitowidigdo/react-simple-contact/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
